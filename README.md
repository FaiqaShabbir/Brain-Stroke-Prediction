# Brain-Stroke-Prediction

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke based on patient data. This project leverages data science and predictive modeling to assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and improving patient outcomes.

## Features
- Predicts the probability of a brain stroke using patient health data
- Utilizes a trained machine learning model (`model.pickle`)
- Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development
- Easy-to-use interface for experimentation and further development

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Brain-Stroke-Prediction
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required packages (example):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install common packages: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, jupyter)*

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter notebooks in your preferred environment:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook
  ```
- Explore and run the cells in `Atom_BrainStrokePrediction (1).ipynb` or `stroke_prediction.ipynb` to analyze data and make predictions.
- The trained model is saved as `model.pickle` and can be loaded for inference.

## Model Information
- The model was trained on health-related features to predict stroke risk.
- For details on data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, refer to the provided notebooks.
