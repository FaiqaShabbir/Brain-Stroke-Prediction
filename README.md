In this project, we will predict whether a patient will have a heart stroke or not based on his/her comorbidities, work, and lifestyle. Projects like these are widely applied in the healthcare sector, doing this project will impart you a better understanding of analysis of data, data cleaning, data visualizations, and algorithms.

Data set — The stroke data is available on Kaggle.

This dataset lists multiple features like gender, age, glucose level, BMI, smoking status, other comorbidities, etc., and the target variable: stroke. Each row specifies a patient’s relevant information. Following are the features listed in the dataset:

1) id: unique identifier

2) gender: “Male”, “Female” or “Other”

3) age: age of the patient

4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn’t have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension

5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn’t have any heart diseases, 1 if the the patient has a heart disease

6) ever_married: “No” or “Yes”

7) work_type: “children”, “Govt_jov”, “Never_worked”, “Private” or “Self-employed”

8) Residence_type: “Rural” or “Urban”

9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood

10) BMI: body mass index

11) smoking_status: “formerly smoked”, “never smoked”, “smokes” or “Unknown”*

12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not

This dataset lists all the relevant information required to predict stroke chances and these identifiers are often used by medical practitioners as well. These input parameters can be used to predict the chances of stroke in a patient.
